# Tailwind Recipe Website

I created this website as part of a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gpXORlEHjc5bgnIi5HEGhw) in how to build websites with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

I really loved every step of this project, and I can say with a high degree of confidence that I will be using Tailwind in future projects.

Tailwind's CSS utility classes made writing the styles so much faster and with less CSS reference checking. It also allows you to write your own custom CSS styles as well, which is fantastic.
